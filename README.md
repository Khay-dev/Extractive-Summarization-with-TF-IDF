# Extractive Summarization with TF-IDF

This project provides a complete solution for extractive summarization based on the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm. It includes both the server and client components to offer summarization as a service and provide a client for interacting with the service.

## Server

The `server` folder contains the server-side code for the extractive summarization service.

## Client

The `client` folder contains the client-side code for interacting with the extractive summarization service provided by the server. It includes files for making API requests and handling responses.
